# Computational_Human_Genomics_project

This project involves the comparison of sequencing alignment of the chromosomes 15, 16, 17, and 18, of a patient defined as a control and one in a tumorous state. The work was carried out by Vittoria Ossanna, Filippo Mirolo, and myself, with each of us contributing equally to the development of the project. In this repository, you will find the [report](./CHG project.docx) in which is described, in detail, every step performed to completely analyze the assigned data, in the report you will find a link to a Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TlTxTG9oP44GxuqyRWUQYxPfHs1eXaZk) that include all the scripts used.
